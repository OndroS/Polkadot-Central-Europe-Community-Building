# Polkadot-Central-Europe-Community-Building
We want to raise engagement in Central Europe blockchain community about Polkadot and Web3 related technologies (Substrate, libp2p,etc.) by organising meetups, workshops and hackathons in our blockchain cowork space Progressbar in Bratislava and other cities nearby - Vienna, Prague. Events will be streamed and followed by videos and blogs afterwards.
